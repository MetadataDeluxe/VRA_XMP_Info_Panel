About
The VRA panel is meant to facilitate sharing descriptive metadata between a user and a chosen recipient, such as a database curator, an image sharing service, or a colleague.
 
Objectives:
Allow curators and collection managers to more efficiently collect metadata from faculty and student contributors and ingest it into a central database.
Allow database assistants to enter pre-cataloging information, i.e., source captions, original resource documentation, or backlog tracking information.
Empower contributors to keep embedded metadata in their image files for the purpose of managing them with common desktop photo applications and sharing with colleagues and students.
Use Adobe Bridge's bulk metadata input and editing capabilities to increase efficiency.
Create data that is both Core 4 and IPTC compatible, i.e., it is interoperable with most photo software and can be easily ingested into a Visual Resources database.
Facilitate the creation of semantic web ready digital images that are self-describing through the use of embedded RDF/XML metadata.
